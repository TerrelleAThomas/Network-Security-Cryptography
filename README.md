# Security Risk Assessment for Secure Client-Server Calculator Application

| **Vulnerability**             | **Threat Description**                                                                              | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unauthorized Access            | Exploits that allow unauthorized users to access server resources                                  | High           | Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as MFA.                    |
| SQL Injection                  | Malicious SQL commands executed via input fields, potentially compromising the database            | High           | Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to avoid direct SQL injection. |
| Denial of Service (DoS)        | Attacks aimed at overwhelming the server to make it unavailable for legitimate users               | High           | Implement rate limiting, web application firewalls (WAF), and traffic filtering. |
| Malware on Client Devices      | Malicious software infecting user devices, potentially compromising security                       | Medium         | Educate users on safe browsing habits, provide anti-malware recommendations.   |
| Insecure APIs                  | APIs with improper security measures, allowing unauthorized access to backend functionality        | High           | Use token-based authentication, validate all inputs, and secure API endpoints.  |
| Weak Password Policies         | Users may use simple or weak passwords, making accounts susceptible to brute-force attacks         | Medium         | Enforce strong password requirements, such as complexity, length, and expiration policies. |
| Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Single-factor authentication increases the risk of unauthorized access to accounts | High           | Integrate MFA into the authentication process for all users.                   |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)     | Attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages that execute in the user's browser               | Medium         | Implement proper input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent script execution. |
| Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Attack forces users to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge                      | Medium         | Use anti-CSRF tokens to verify requests and ensure they're coming from authenticated users. |
| Insecure Data Storage          | Sensitive data stored insecurely on the server or client-side, leading to possible data leaks     | High           | Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms. |
| Open Ports                     | Unnecessary services running on open ports could be exploited by attackers                         | Medium         | Perform regular port scanning, disable unused ports, and harden firewall rules.  |
| Inadequate Session Management  | Weak session handling could lead to session hijacking                                              | Medium         | Use secure cookies, set session timeouts, and implement proper session management. |

## Summary of Security Risks and Recommendations

The secure client-server calculator application is exposed to several common vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access, SQL injection, DoS attacks, and insufficient authentication mechanisms. By addressing these risks with the appropriate mitigation strategies, the application will be better protected against potential attacks.

**Ongoing Steps:**
- Perform regular vulnerability scans and security audits.
- Implement continuous monitoring for real-time detection of threats.
- Keep all software dependencies and libraries up to date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
