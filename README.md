| **Server-Side**           | Unauthorized Access, SQL Injection, DoS               | Input validation, firewalls, prepared statements, rate limiting.   |
| **Data in Transit**       | Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attacks                      | Use SSL/TLS encryption for all communications.                    |
| **Data at Rest**          | Data Breaches, Insecure Storage                       | Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256, apply access control.        |
| **Session Management**    | Session Hijacking, Token Theft                        | Secure session tokens, implement timeouts and secure cookies.      |

## 2. Compliance Requirements

To ensure that your application meets legal and regulatory standards, the following compliance requirements should be addressed:

| **Compliance Standard**   | **Requirement**                                          | **Applicability**                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **GDPR**                  | Protect user data, provide transparency, obtain consent  | Required if users are in the EU.               |
| **HIPAA**                 | Safeguard health-related data                            | If handling health-related data.               |
| **PCI DSS**               | Secure payment data                                      | If handling payment transactions.              |
| **ISO/IEC 27001**         | Establish an ISMS (Information Security Management System) | General information security.                  |
| **SSDF**                  | Integrate security throughout the SDLC                   | Secure Software Development Framework applies. |

## 3. Secure Coding Practices

Secure coding practices help prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and broken authentication. Key practices include:

| **Secure Coding Practice**           | **Description**                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Validation**                 | Validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows.  |
| **Use of Prepared Statements**       | Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.                 |
| **Session Management**               | Implement secure cookie flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`), session expiration. |
| **Encryption**                       | Use TLS for data in transit, encrypt sensitive data at rest.          |
| **Error Handling**                   | Avoid exposing internal system details in error messages.             |
| **Least Privilege Principle**        | Give only necessary permissions to users and services.                |

## 4. Vulnerability Scanning Results

Vulnerability scanning is essential for identifying weaknesses. Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or Burp Suite. Here are some common results:

| **Vulnerability**        | **Risk Level**   | **Mitigation**                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection             | High             | Implement prepared statements and input validation.          |
| Insecure Session Handling | Medium           | Use secure cookies, set timeouts, and enable session management. |
| Weak Password Policy      | Medium           | Enforce strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication. |

## 5. Security Testing

To ensure security throughout the SDLC, implement the following testing techniques:

| **Security Test**                | **Purpose**                                              |

| **Network Segmentation**         | Limit access to critical resources by segmenting the network.             |
| **VPN**                          | Secure access to the server over untrusted networks.                      |
